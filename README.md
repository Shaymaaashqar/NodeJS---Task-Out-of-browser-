# NodeJS---Task-Out-of-browser-
I create a Node JS file `main.js`
In this file, 
I read a file from the file system (same folder of main.js) called user.csv.
 Each of the lines represents user data, I switch this line to a JS object.
All these objects must be stored in an array `users`.
**AND THERE IS 4 FUNCTIONS**
- `readCSV`: It will be responsible to read from the plain `users.csv` file.
- 'readPlain' : which will be responsible to read from that pain input.txt file.
- 'saveToFile': which will take array of users as a parameter and save it to a JSON file.
- 'readJsonFile': that will read the previous file and print it in console.
